The project explores a number of widely used data structures and algorithms.  
There are several functions written in Python3 and an accompanying Jupyter Notebook detailing the process.
An attached pdf details the project instructions.


To run the notebook, replace the text file with your own file created as specified in the project instructions pdf.
