# Connect-The-Islands
This is a Data Structures and Algorithms Mini Project taken from a 2016 ACM-ICPC local contest.


The project explores a number of widely used data structures and algorithms.  
There are several functions written in Python3 and an accompanying Jupyter Notebook detailing the process.
An attached pdf details the project instructions.
